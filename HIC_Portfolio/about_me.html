            Hi! My name is Charles Gale.<br><br>
            I am a CS major at Kent State University, Ohio. A little about me, I am the oldest of 7 children. Some of my favorite
            hobbies are running, reading, and playing video games. I ran cross-country competitively for 10 years from 3rd grade 
            until I graduated highschool in 2023. After graduation, I started training for marathons and have since completed three.<br><br>

            At Kent State, I am also part of the AFROTC program. This is a program designed to train students to become officers in the
            United States Air Force. I have completed my Field Training requirement and have contracted meaning I have proved myself
            and will join the air force as an officer upon graduation. In this program I was fortunate enough to be accepted into a summer
            program called SWOC (Special Warfare Orientation Course). This is a two week course at the Air Force Academy in Colorado that is 
            designed to educate cadets on the requirements and lifestyle of the 19ZX (Special Warfare) career field.<br><br>

            It is my hope to commission into the Air Force as a 17X (Cyber Officer). My current degree and possible intership, I will be applying
            this December, will set me up for success in this career.
