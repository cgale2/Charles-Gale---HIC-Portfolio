            Here are a some short descriptions of some of the projects I have worked on while being a CS student at Kent State Universtiy:<br><br>

            1. My Freshman year I made a tic-tac-toe game implemented using c++. The display for the game was a .txt file that I deleted and then re-wrote to
            to represent the visual side of the game. I later updated this game my Sophmore year by reading in the data on the .txt file and using that data to 
            write over the existing text in the file to more seamlessly update the game's visual side.<br><br>

            2. During the spring semester of my Sophmore year I learned to use APIs to create a running club for my AFROTC detachment. I saw a problem of previous
            fitness challenges where cadets needed to manually log all of their activity on a google sheet in order to keep track of all of the scores. I improved 
            on this by creating a Strava group for my detachment and using an API along with JavaScript through Google Apps Script to automatically pull the data 
            from people's runs and put that into a sheet for them to easily view and compare with their peers.<br><br>
            
            3. This semester I have been working on creating an app of sorts for my AFROTC detachment's attendance tracking. I have done this using google forms to
            collect the attendance data each day. From there the forms are linked to a google sheet where I use c++ to manage the data. I setup a API for the google sheet
            with OAuth 2.0 to protect people's data. The API pulls the data from the google sheet and puts it into a .json file which I then read in with c++, organize, manage,
            and then formatt back into a new .json file to be exported back to the google sheet. This is all done with Make to simplify the compiling process. Finally, I've continued
            to use JavaScript through Google Apps Script to then color the data in the google sheet to make it more readable. I've also used the JavaScript here with some 
            HTML in order to read through the google sheet's data and automatially send emails to cadets who have missed too many classes. It plan on making this into a proper website
            over winter break so that other cadets may continue to use this code in the future.
